# Î© Olympus V2 Smart Contract Analysis

## Overview
One of the best ways to come up to speed on solidity, smart contracts, DeFi, and Olympus V2 is to dive into the code. The following posts are my notes as I've been digging into the Olympus V2 contracts to better understand how it all works.

This repository contains some scripts I've developed to investigate the v2 contracts along with some changes and additions to support deploying to the IOTA EVM testnet.

This repository is forked from the [Olympus Contracts Repository](https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts.git) and references the `v2.0` tag (commit `3bb3605`)
